Lenticular prints (also sometimes known as 'holographic'), are images that appear to move when you tilt them. As an example, here's one that I made by hand:

When making this art project, I realized that the process wasn't too difficult, just very tedious and lacking in clear resources online. So, I created this app to automate creating lenticular images for print and explain how lenticular images work, with my art teacher as a client, in the hopes of implementing this project in art class. 

This was made for my highschool IB Computer Science final project. (The Internal Assesment)
